Here are the steps I took to update a recent project:
<ol>
  <li>
  Install the .NET Core 2.2 SDK from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2. The SDK download will also install the runtime.
  </li>
  <li>
  Update the TargetFramework attribute in the project's .csproj file:
  ```
  <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework>
  ```      
  </li>
  <li>
  Run the command line `dotnet list package --outdated` to find which packages might need to be updated.  With certain packages, you're required to update them or the project won't compiled (ie `dotnet build`).
  ~~In my case, I had to update two packages from version 2.1.0 to 2.2.0~~:
  ```
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design" Version="2.2.0" />
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer" Version="2.2.0" />
  ```
  *Update 12/11/2018:  I didn't even need to include, and therefore update, those two packages since they are included in the Microsoft.AspNetCore.App package.*
  </li>
  <li>
  Run the command line `dotnet build`.  This command will implicitly run the command `dotnet restore`, which does the actual work of updating the packages, and then it will compile the application.
  </li>
  <li>
  Update the correct path to the project's dll in the .vscode\launch.json file.  Since I used Visual Studio Code as my editor, I updated the path to make sure debugging continue to work correctly:  
  ```
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp2.2\\ExpenseMgmt.dll"
  ```
  </li>
</ol>
